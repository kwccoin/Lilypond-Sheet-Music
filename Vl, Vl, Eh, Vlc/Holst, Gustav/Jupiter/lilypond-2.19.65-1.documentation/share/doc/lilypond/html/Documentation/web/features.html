<h2 class="unnumberedsec">Features</h2>
<div class="column-center-top">

<a name="Excellent-classical-engraving"></a>
<h3 class="subheading">Excellent classical engraving</h3>

<img class="float-right" src="../pictures/flat-design.png" alt="flat-design">
<p>LilyPond allows musicians to produce elegant sheet music that is
easy to read.  Its developer community has spent thousands of hours
developing powerful music engraving software that results in beautifully
engraved music.  All of LilyPond&rsquo;s style settings, font designs and
algorithms have been inspired by the finest hand-engraved music.
LilyPond output has the same strong, balanced and elegant look as the
best-engraved classical scores.  This is further explained in our
<a href="essay.html">Essay</a>.
</p>


</div>
<div class="column-center-top"><a name="Text-input-2"></a>
<h3 class="subheading">Text input</h3>

<a name="Everything-is-explicit"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading">Everything is explicit</h4>

<p>LilyPond processes text input, which contains all information
about the <em>content</em> of your score and can easily be read
by any human or another program. There are no obscure
settings hidden behind menu items and binary file storage.
</p>
<p>Read more about this concept on <a href="text-input.html">Text input</a>.
</p>

<a name="Tweaks-are-robust-and-traceable"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading">Tweaks are robust and traceable</h4>

<p>If you have to change anything in the layout this tweak will
also be explicitly visible in the input file in human-readable
form, so you will always be able to retrace what you&rsquo;ve done.
If you should accidentally break anything you can easily revert
or modify any decision without being at the mercy of an
<em>Undo</em> function.
</p>

<a name="Text-files-are-failure_002d-and-future_002dproof"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading">Text files are failure- and future-proof</h4>

<p>Text files are very robust against file corruption. And as they are
human-readable, you will always be able to interpret them even if
you don&rsquo;t have access to the programs that created them.
</p>

<a name="Manage-your-scores-with-version-control"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading">Manage your scores with version control</h4>

<p>Text files are applicable to be managed by version control. Go
for it and experience infinite and selective undo/redo mechanisms
and the full development history of your scores. Version control
may also open up new (collaborative) workflows for you.
</p>

</div>
<div class="column-center-top"><a name="Usability"></a>
<h3 class="subheading">Usability</h3>

<img class="float-right" src="../pictures/lilypond-book.png" alt="lilypond-book">

<a name="Effective-layout-choices"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading">Effective layout choices</h4>

<p>Spend less time with tweaking the output; LilyPond gets the
formatting correct right from the start.  It determines spacing by
itself, and breaks lines and pages to provide a tight and uniform
layout.  Clashes between lyrics, notes, and chords are resolved
and slurs and beams are sloped, automatically!
</p>

<a name="Mix-music-and-text"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading">Mix music and text</h4>

<p>Put fragments of music into texts without cutting and pasting
pictures.  Integrate music into LaTeX or HTML seamlessly, or add
music to OpenOffice.org and LibreOffice with
<a href="http://extensions.services.openoffice.org/en/project/OOoLilyPond">OOoLilypond</a>.
Plugins are also available to allow LilyPond code in various blogs and
wikis, making online collaboration possible.
</p>

<a name="Accessibility"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading">Accessibility</h4>

<p>Text-based input also makes score-writing possible for users with
severe physical disabilities.  Dexterity-impaired users who are
unable to type or control a computer mouse can use
speech-recognition software to edit LilyPond files.  Even users
who are totally blind can use screen-reading software to write
LilyPond files &ndash; an impossible task in graphical-based
score-writing programs.
You can see a spectacular score on <a href="examples.html">Examples</a>.
</p>
<a name="Editor-diversity"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading">Editor diversity</h4>

<p>Several developers, themselves active LilyPond users,
have written tools specifically aimed at making the process of editing
LilyPond files faster and more effective; you are not tied to
a single user interface but can use different tools for different tasks.
You can even use a full-fledged LilyPond editor at home and use your
mobile phone&rsquo;s notepad app to edit the files on the go. For some examples,
see <a href="easier-editing.html">Easier editing</a>.
</p>

<div class="column-center-top">
<a name="Extensible-design"></a>
<h3 class="subheading">Extensible design</h3>

<a name="Easy-management-of-style-sheets"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading">Easy management of style sheets</h4>

<p>All layout settings can be changed to suit your personal typographical
taste. So you can easily write style sheets that change every aspect of
LilyPond scores&rsquo; default appearance. As these are also written as text
and can be stored in separate files you can simply switch between two
stylesheets to produce scores with a completely different appearance or
layout.
You want to print a score on A4 paper and project it with a beamer,
one system per page? LilyPond&rsquo;s layout engine will effortlessly produce
both from the same input.
</p>
<a name="Add-your-own-functions"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading">Add your own functions</h4>

<p>If that still is not enough, there is always the built-in
scripting language Scheme, which can access LilyPond&rsquo;s layout
engine at the same level as LilyPond itself does, making it
a <em>very</em> powerful tool.
Settings, variables and functions are all documented in the
comprehensive program reference manual.
</p>
<a name="Process-scores-programmatically"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading">Process scores programmatically</h4>

<p>LilyPond input files can fully be edited or even generated by programs
and scripts. This can for example be used for algorithmical composition.
But you can also access the musical content for analysis, or manage
input fragments in a database. There are no limitations except your
imagination.
</p>

<a name="Create-new-tools-using-LilyPond"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading">Create new tools using LilyPond</h4>

<p>As LilyPond isn&rsquo;t a monolithic GUI program but a command line tool it
can be used from within other applications too. This way it is possible
to equip tools like e.g. web applications with LilyPond&rsquo;s engraving
power. There already exist several online tools using LilyPond.

<a name="Excellent-support"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading">Excellent support</h4>

<p>LilyPond runs on all popular platforms: GNU/Linux, MacOS X, and
Windows.  LilyPond comes with extensive documentation and hundreds
of example files.  There is an active user community answering
questions on the lilypond-user mailing list, offering you friendly
help. The response time is usually very short, and often brillant
solutions to reported problems are developed. Thanks to the close
interaction with the development team such solutions are regularly
included in LilyPond itself.

<a name="Free-software"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading">Free software</h4>

<p>LilyPond can be downloaded free of charge!  Yep - It&rsquo;s free.  Get
it from the download page.
</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also free (as in &ldquo;speech&rdquo;) software.  It comes with source
code, and permission to change and copy it.  So, are you irritated
by a bug, or yearning for a feature? Simply add it yourself, or
pay someone else to do it.

we depend on an external entity here, which we cannot control.  Suppose
we go from 2.15.x to 2.17.x and put the documentation under "v2.17".
For some time, Google won't have the new location in its index, so the
search would get nothing.  It would be better to keep "v2.15" in the
