<h3 class="subheading">What is Google Summer of Code?</h3>

<p><a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com">GSoC</a> is a global program
that offers students stipends to write code for free software and open
source projects during the summer.  For three months students work to
complete a given task as part of the project&rsquo;s community and under the
guidance of experienced mentors.  The program is an excellent
opportunity for students to gain experience with real-world software
development and make a contribution that benefits everyone.  It brings
new contributors to LilyPond and enables students who are already
involved to become more involved.  LilyPond participates in GSoC as part
of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org">GNU project</a>.
</p>
<p>We have had GSoC participants in 2012, 2015, 2016 and 2017.  This site
will be updated in time before the 2018 season will start.
</p>

</div>
<div class="column-center-middle-color2 bigger-subsubheadings"><a name="Project-Ideas-List"></a>
<h3 class="subheading">Project Ideas List</h3>

<p>Below is a list of GSoC project ideas (last update: May 2017), but
if you have other ideas for a project you may complete within the three
months of the program you&rsquo;re welcome to make a suggestion on our
developer mailing list (see <a href="contact.es.html">Contacto</a>).  There are a number of areas
where LilyPond could be improved, and our development team is always
willing to help those who would like to tackle a project similar to
those listed below.  As mentor availability varies from project to
project and from year to year it is wise to get in touch with us as
early as possible.
</p>
<p>A full list of all the current open issues can be found
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/testlilyissues/issues">here</a>.
</p>

<a name="Adopt-the-SMuFL-music-font-encoding-standard"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading">Adopt the SMuFL music font encoding standard</h4>

<p>For several years now a new standard for music fonts has been around:
<a href="http://www.smufl.org">SMuFL</a>, which is also discussed as becoming part of
a future W3C standard for music encoding.  As a FLOSS tool LilyPond should
adhere to such an open standard instead of using an isolated solution like it
does today.  Adopting SMuFL will help integrating LilyPond with the world of
music notation software and eventually give LilyPond users access to a wider
selection of notation fonts.
</p>
<p>Making LilyPond compliant to SMuFL includes remapping of the glyphs that are
built from METAFONT sources, adjusting the glyphs&rsquo; metrics to SMuFL&rsquo;s
specifications, and finally updating the way LilyPond looks up and positions the
glyphs.  As an optional part of this project LilyPond&rsquo;s font loading mechanism
could be modified to use notation fonts installed as system fonts instead of
inside the LilyPond installation.
</p>
<p><em>Difficulty</em>: Easy/medium
</p>
<p><em>Requirements</em>: C++ and willingness to get familiar with LilyPond
internals.
</p>
<p><em>Recommended</em>: Interest and experience in working with font files.
A little bit of METAFONT.
</p>
<p><em>Mentors</em>: Werner Lemberg, Abraham Lee
</p>

<a name="Adding-variants-of-font-glyphs"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading">Adding variants of font glyphs</h4>

<div class="keep-bullets"><ul>
<li>
Adding &lsquo;on&rsquo; and &lsquo;between&rsquo; staff-line variants.

</li><li>
Shorter and narrower variants of some glyphs for example, accidentals.
Another, more specific example could be an ancient notation breve
notehead coming in two variants one with a small or big &lsquo;hole&rsquo; within
it.

</li></ul>

</div>
<p><em>Difficulty:</em> easy
</p>
<p><em>Requirements:</em> MetaFont, C++, good eye for details
</p>
<p><em>Recommended knowledge:</em> basic LilyPond knowledge
</p>
<p><em>Mentor:</em> Werner Lemberg
</p>

<a name="Contemporary-Notation"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading">Contemporary Notation</h4>

<p>LilyPond is very good at creating non-standard notation.  Having to
<em>code</em> every graphical element instead of simply <em>drawing</em>
it may seem cumbersome but is in fact a strong asset.  New notational
functionality can be provided with consistent appearance, automatic
layout and a natural syntactic interface.
</p>
<p>Within the <a href="https://github.com/openlilylib/oll-core">openLilyLib</a>
library system the student will create a fundamental infrastructure
and building blocks to make creating contemporary notation easier.
Additionally (at least) <em>one</em> concrete package is developed to
cover specific contemporary notation, such as for example the style
of a given composer, extended playing techniques for a specific
instrument or a certain category of effects.
</p>
<p><em>Difficulty:</em> medium
</p>
<p><em>Requirements:</em> Scheme (interaction with LilyPond internals),
contemporary notation techniques
</p>
<p><em>Recommended:</em> sense of building hierarchical frameworks
</p>
<p><em>Mentors:</em> <em>NN,</em> Urs Liska
</p>

<a name="Rewrite-LibreOffice-LilyPond-Extension-with-Python"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading">Rewrite LibreOffice LilyPond Extension with Python</h4>

<p>The <a href="http://ooolilypond.sourceforge.net">OOoLilyPond</a> extension
made it possible to conveniently include LilyPond score snippets in
OpenOffice.org/LibreOffice Writer, Draw and Impress documents while
keeping source and image together.  After many years without development
an initial effort has started to make the extension compatible again
with current versions of LibreOffice and LilyPond.
</p>
<p>However, as the LibreOffice ecosystem has changed substantially it is
now possible to rewrite the extension with Python and PyQt.  This will
not only be more powerful in general but will allow the integration of
functionality from <a href="http://frescobaldi.org">Frescobaldi</a>, such as
for example syntax highlighting, entry helpers, score wizards or musical
transformations.
</p>
<p><em>Difficulty:</em> easy/medium
</p>
<p><em>Requirements:</em> Python, PyQt, LilyPond basics, LibreOffice
extension basics
</p>
<p><em>Recommended knowledge:</em> Familiarity with Frescobaldi code based
or willingness to learn during bonding period
</p>
<p><em>Mentor(s):</em> Joram Berger, Urs Liska, (Thorsten Behrens/LibreOffice)
</p>

<a name="Automated-testing-and-documentation-for-openLilyLib"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading">Automated testing and documentation for openLilyLib</h4>

<p><a href="https://github.com/openlilylib">openLilyLib</a> is an extension
framework for LilyPond code providing a “snippets” repository and a
suite of integrated packages such as for example page layout tools or
scholarly annotations.  It is very powerful and promising, but to really
get off the ground two features are missing: automated testing and
documentation generation.
</p>
<p>Automated testing is necessary to ensure modifications to functionality
don&rsquo;t break other functions within the library.  There is already some
Automated Testing of the “snippets” repository with Github&rsquo;s Travis
server, but this has to be reconsidered and extended to cover the
standalone packages too.
</p>
<p>In order to be usable for a wider range of LilyPond users on a “consumer
level” openLilyLib needs proper documentation.  This documentation has
to be generated from the sources, so a system is needed that requires
package authors to document the input files and provide additional usage
examples, from which documentation is generated.  Ideally but not
necessarily this is implemented as a Git hook, i.e. automatically upon
each update to the repository.  We don&rsquo;t prescribe the tools and
approaches to be used, but the most widely used language in the LilyPond
domain is Python, so there would be some bias towards that.
Alternatively a Scheme solution could be fine so generating the
documentation would actually be triggered by “compiling” a certain
LilyPond input file.  In general it is advisable to make use of proven
concepts and tools from other languages.
</p>
<p>The eventual output of the documentation should be a static HTML site
that can be viewed locally and/or uploaded to a website.  But it would
be beneficial if the tool would first generate an intermediate
representation (e.g. a JSON file with additional media files) from which
a Single Page Application could retrieve content for display on
openLilyLib&rsquo;s <a href="https://openlilylib.org">website</a>.  Development of
such a SPA <em>can</em> be part of the GSoC project, but is optional.
</p>
<p><em>Difficulty:</em> medium
</p>
<p><em>Requirements:</em> Python or Scheme, static website generator(s) or
(Node.js based) dynamic web application technology. Continuous
Integration (can be learned during the bonding period)
</p>
<p><em>Mentors:</em> Urs Liska, Matteo Ceccarello
</p>

<a name="MusicXML"></a>
<h4 class="subsubheading">MusicXML</h4>

<p>Improving MusicXML import and export functions:
</p>
<p>File interchange between LilyPond and other applications using MusicXML
is still a difficult matter.  To import MusicXML it has to be converted
manually by the <code>musicxml2ly</code> script.  Export <em>to</em> MusicXML is
only available as a rudimentary feature inside Frescobaldi.  In order to
provide natural interchange between LilyPond and MusicXML based
applications there&rsquo;s the need of actual import functionality and a
dedicated export backend.
</p>
<p>Importing XML shall provide file, line and column to add origin
attributes to generated objects.  That way point and click can be
made available in Frescobaldi or other supported IDEs.
</p>
<p>Exporting XML shall be realized with an exporter class like the MIDI
export.  This may be based on the work already done in
<a href="https://github.com/DavidGarfinkle/Lilypond_MusicXMLexport">GSoC 2015</a>
by David Garfinkle.  It should be checked if it is possible to use
another XML library than the one provided by guile-2 in order to have
this feature available in current LilyPond (which is based on guile-1.8).
</p>
<p><em>Difficulty:</em> medium
</p>
<p><em>Requirements:</em> MusicXML, Python, Scheme, basic LilyPond knowledge
</p>
<p><em>Recommended:</em> Familiarity with other scorewriters (for cross-testing)
</p>
<p><em>Mentor:</em> Jan-Peter Voigt

<div class="column-center-middle-color2"><a name="Information-for-Applicants_002fParticipants"></a>
<h3 class="subheading">Information for Applicants/Participants</h3>

<p>In order to have a satisfying experience with GSoC applicants are
strongly advised to thoroughly read the following recommendations.  Some
of these are relevant for the application process, others for the time
within the project.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Read all applicable information on the program&rsquo;s website, particularly
the
<a href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/resources/manual">students&rsquo; manual</a>.  Make sure you fulfil all of Google&rsquo;s prerequisites
and are willing to join the program as a full-time commitment over the
coding period of three months.

</li><li>
Please get in touch with us as soon as possible if you are interested in
applying with a project.  Mentor availability may change without notice,
project proposals may need fine-tuning, and many other reasons might
require us to reject or ignore an application that hasn&rsquo;t been discussed
before.

</li><li>
We do not know in advance how many “slots” we will have available for
projects, so please be aware that you may find yourself in competition
with other applicants or not.  Interested or even enthusiastic response
from our mentors is no guarantee of eventually being accepted, and
<em>not</em> being accepted does not necessarily indicate a negative
evaluation of your application.  If we have to decide between different
applicants there may be various aspects to consider.

</li><li>
Integration in the LilyPond community is a fundamental part of GSoC, and
we expect our students to make substantial efforts to become community
members.  Within the <em>bonding period</em> we expect you to write a blog
post about your project (either on <a href="http://lilypondblog.org">Scores of Beauty</a> or on any other blog) and to be active on our mailing lists,
introducing yourself but also communicating about unrelated tasks.  This
goes beyond the mere setting up of a working environment and
familiarizing yourself with the relevant code, but we think it is
crucial for the GSoC project to be mutually satisfying.

</li><li>
If you are accepted to the program you will have one mentor explicitly
assigned to your project.  With this mentor you will have to agree upon
a communication strategy, be it emails, chatrooms, issue trackers or
voice/video chats.  Regular communication is absolutely crucial for the
success of a GSoC project so you are stricly required to keep talking to
your mentor.  But keep in mind that your mentor has explicitly taken
over the responsibility for your project, and while unlike you he isn&rsquo;t
paid for this activity you are still entitled to get regular attention
from him.

</li><li>
In order to get support from your mentor you have to give him a chance
to follow your progress and efforts.  Therefore it is important to
regularly commit your changes to the versioning repository you are
working on.  Don&rsquo;t hesitate making unfinished code available because you
are afraid of criticism, and don&rsquo;t suppress questions because you think
they might be considered stupid.  But ideally your code should at any
time be accompanied by compatible testing code.  Your mentor may not be
able to properly assess your code by only <em>reading</em> it without the
opportunity to apply it in a real example.

</li></ul>

<p>There is a list of inactive projects in the <a href="attic.es.html">Desván</a>.  We list
projects there that are still considered valuable but for which there
are currently no mentors available.
